# Housing-Price-Prediction
Predicting prices for accommodation using Airbnb data.

Project Motivation:
In this project, I was interested in predicting accommodation prices with some basic analysis and modelling with help of Airbnb Seatle dataset from Kaggel.


Step by step approach
1. Lets first explore the dataset first - Shape, type of columns and etc.
2. Data preprocessing -  Remove or imputing missing values & How we deal with them?
3. Explore Insigts to get key aspects of the data and its key features.
4. Feature Engineering - There are lot techniques to determine the right feature to predict the prices.
5. Modelling

Required libraries:
1. Pandas
2. Numpy
3. Sckit Learn 
4. Linear Regression 
5. XGBoost

Resources for the data:
1. https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle
2. Airbnb website
